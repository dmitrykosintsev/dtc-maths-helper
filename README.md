# Math helper

This chatbot is created in order to provide students with a tool that will allow them to practice solving various maths problems with an immidiate feedback about their solution. To my knowledge, there are no popular systems that work in this way.

Here are a few chatbots that work with maths:
* MathGPT by Mathful: can be used to solve questions. However, it does not provide "communication", i.e. there is no way to respond to the output from MathGPT without starting a new chat.
* MathChat: this is a research project that should be deployed. Moreover, the framework is built upon ChatGPT-4o, and the author notes the LLM struggles to solve complex questions.
* DeepAI's Math AI: the closest solution to allow for conversations. However, it provides solutions to questions by default.
